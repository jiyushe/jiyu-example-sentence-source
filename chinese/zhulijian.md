<p><span class="chinese">他们试图通过制造主力舰来纠正这点，但是更多的是一种灾难。</span><span class="english">And their attempts to fix this by building capitol ships was largely a disaster.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">看起来没有主力舰的损失，也许巡洋舰或驱逐舰的损失也不大。</span><span class="english">Apparently no battleship was lost, and probably not much in the way of cruisers or destroyers.</span></p>
