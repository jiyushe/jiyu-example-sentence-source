# 整除

<p><span class="chinese">但能被400整除的世纪年2000年，则为闰年。</span><span class="english">But century years divisible by 400, like 2000, would be leap years.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">问这个两位数可被6整除的概率是多少？</span><span class="english">What is the probability that the two-digit number is divisible by 6?</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">例如17就是质数，因为它只能被1和17整除。</span><span class="english">The number 17, for example, is prime, because it is divisible only by 1 and 17.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">发现可被100整除的年份不一定是闰年，除非它能被400整除。</span><span class="english">Years that are divisible by 100 are not leap years, unless they're also divisible by 400.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">在LCN检测中，每个样品被分为三个部分或是能被三整除的，其中两个部门用于检测。</span><span class="english">In LCN testing, each sample is divided into three parts or aliquots, and two of these are tested.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">一个正整数，如果能被并且只能被1和它本身整除，那么这个数就是一个素数。</span><span class="english">A positive integer is a prime if and only if it is exactly divisible by two integers, 1 and itself.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">除了世纪开始的年份外，所有被四整除的年份应是由366天构成的闰年。</span><span class="english">All years that are divisible by 4 should be leap years of 366 days, except those which coincide with the beginning of a century.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">数学归纳法可以用来证明与正整数有关的恒等式、不等式、整除性问题和几何问题等。</span><span class="english">Mathematical induction can be used to prove the positive integers and Identities, inequality, and the divisibility of geometric problems.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">最后，证明了带有左整除序关系的链的零半群是左△-序半群。</span><span class="english">We finally prove that the nil ordered semigroups which are chains with respect to the divisibility ordering are left △-ordered semigroups.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">具体的看这事，考虑用长除法?如果你能在纸上做长整除，现在就举起你的手。会有人举手吗?我可不这么认为。</span><span class="english">To put this in perspective, think about long division. Raise your hand if you can do long division on paper, right now. Hands? Anyone? I didn't think so.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">本文就整数的整除性判断的重要方法——割尾法的理论与实践进行了初步探索。</span><span class="english">The essay has done the first research to the theory and practice of the end-cutting method which is an important method to judge the divisibility of integer.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">这三个主题上每位参与者的分数都被加起来，然后被3整除，以得到每个参与者的每一个字幕速度的跨主题的合成分数。</span><span class="english">The scores on the three topics for each participant were added together and divided by 3 to get across-topic composite scores for each speed for each participant.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">针对整数论中数的整除特征进行了研究，从理论上解决了任意整数的整除特征问题。</span><span class="english">This paper studies the numeral divisibility characteristic of round number, and solves the problem in theory about the divisibility characteristic of any round number.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">这里没有探测，所以不需要担心探测会因为表容量能被步长整除，而陷入无限的循环中。</span><span class="english">There are no probes in separate chaining, so there's no need to worry that a probe will go into an endless sequence because the step size divides evenly into the array size.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">特别地，我们还讨论了序零半群，给出了这类半群与偏序半群上的左整除关系链的关系。</span><span class="english">In the paper we introduce the concepts of L-trivial, nil ordered semigroups and give every ordered semigroup is L-trivial if and only if the left divisibility relation is an order.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">介绍了左△-序半群和完全左同余的概念，给出了左整除序关系的链的性质。</span><span class="english">In this paper, the concepts of left △-ordered semigroups and complete left congruences are introduced and some properties which left divisibility ordering relation form a chain are given.</span></p>
