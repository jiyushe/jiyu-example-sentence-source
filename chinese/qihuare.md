<p><span class="chinese">实际上，汽化热与温度有关。</span><span class="english">The heat of vaporization is actually temperature dependent.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">由于汽化热的存在，使气温下降，通过所说的热交换器把室外空气降温后送进室内。</span><span class="english">The outdoor air which has been cooled by said heat exchanger is passed into room.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">对由分子聚集理论得到的液体汽化热的方程进行了修正。</span><span class="english">An equation for predicting evaporation heat of liquids obtained by means of gathering theory was modified.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">本文还运用“界面汽化热阱”概念对传热机理进行了分析。</span><span class="english">Also, the mechanism of this process has been analyzed with the concept of "interfacial vaporization heat sink".</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">对电热法液体汽化热实验进行了研究，设计了新的实验装置。</span><span class="english">The experiment of liquid vaporization heat using electric heating method is studied and a new device is designed.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">水或其他液体可能会被删除从固体机械经过滤或离心或汽化热。</span><span class="english">Water or other liquids may be removed from solids mechanically by filtration or centrifugation or thermally by vaporization.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">用前向神经网络，对纯物质的蒸气压和汽化热与温度的函数关系进行预测。</span><span class="english">A feedforward neural network was used to predict functional relationship of temperature with steam pressure and heat of vaporization of the pure material.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">另外，依据泡核激活机制的转变并结合界面汽化热阱效应对沸腾滞后进行机理分析。</span><span class="english">The boiling hysteresis mechanism has been analyzed on the base of the interfacial vaporization heat sink effect and the change in activation way of boiling nuclei.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">实验结果表明，沸腾时，“界面汽化热阱”效应随热流率的提高而显著增大。</span><span class="english">The experimental results show that in the pool nucleate boiling process the "effect of interfacial vaporization heat sink" obviously increases with the heat transfer flux.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">有孔地膜中地温降低主要是以土壤水分的蒸发——汽化热为主，这些热释放于近地表，可使近地气温提高0-2℃，成为有孔地膜促进早熟、增加早期产量的主要原因。</span><span class="english">Because the heat is released to the nearby soil surface and increases the temperature of the air close to the soil to 0.2℃, PPF mulch contributes to the early-maturing and early-yield increasing.</span></p>
