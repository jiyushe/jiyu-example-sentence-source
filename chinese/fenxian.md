# 粉线

<p><span class="chinese">没错,就是绿线和粉线的交点</span><span class="english">All right, where the green and the pink line intersect.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">为喷粉线的生产工艺、工艺过程和工装操作提供技术支持。</span><span class="english">Technical support to Production for painting methods , process, tools operations.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">这种线迹是按照原始样板复印到面料反面的碳素线或画粉线缝。</span><span class="english">The stitches follow the carbon or chalk lines copied on to the wrong side of the fabric from the original pattern.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">与工艺经理、国外专家等一起参与喷粉线项目的考察、调研活动，新方案的导入、设计方案和线体布局的优化等。</span><span class="english">Work with Methods manager and group expert on project investigation , proposal launching , design solution review and layout improvement.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">这个图的作用是,给定一个S2,找到粉线对应的坐标,然后就能找出参与人I的最佳对策</span><span class="english">The way we read this graph, is you give me an S2, I read across to the pink line and drop down, and that tells me the best response for Player I.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">可以看到蓝线比粉线好,原因是对于任意的预期收益率，蓝线都在粉线的左边，对吧？</span><span class="english">You should see that the blue line is better than the pink line because, for any expected return, the blue line is to the left of the pink line, right?</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">你可以看到那条粉线,表示了洛杉矶的就业情况,实际上,它紧随着洛杉矶市场,兴衰变动,只不过没有那么显著</span><span class="english">Well, you can see the pink line shows the employment in Los Angeles, and indeed, it did move around corresponding to the booms and busts in the Los Angeles market but not so dramatically.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">喷粉是电冰箱生产中的一道重要工序，喷粉线的产能相对较小则会制约公司扩大生产能力。</span><span class="english">Powder spraying is an important process step to produce the refrigerator. The reproductive capacity of the whole company is conditioned if the productive capacity thereof is relatively small.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">我再重复一遍,我知道你们之中有些人数学不怎么好,我放慢一点说,我是这么解的,看这条粉线的方程,还有这条蓝线的方程,X是二者的交点,也就是说这点两个方程相等</span><span class="english">Now, just to repeat, again I know I've got some math phobics in the audience, let me just slow down a second, all I'm doing here is I'm saying look at this equation of the pink line, look at this equation of the blue line, X is when they cross, i.e., they are equal to each other.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">相反如果你认为门将扑向右侧的概率,大于?的情况下,此时你最佳策略用粉线表示,即从左路射门,也就是说如果你觉得门将扑向右路的,概率大于?的话,你最好选择从左路射门</span><span class="english">Conversely, if you think the goalie's  going to shoot to the right with probability more than a ?, then the best you can do is  represented by the pink line, and that's shooting to the left, or if you think the goalie's going to dive to the right with the probability more than a ?, the best you can do, your best response is to shoot to the left.</span></p>
