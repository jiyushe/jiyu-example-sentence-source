<p><span class="chinese">我坦白我成为在男人之间周旋的交际花，以欲望交换权利，奉迎着很多的男人，却不仅为某个男人所有。</span><span class="english">I confess I became a courtesan, traded yearning for power, welcomed many rather than be owned by.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">我们总是要排队等候数小时，不时微笑着像汤姆叔叔那样谄媚奉迎每一位走过的医生和护士。</span><span class="english">We'd better stand on line and wait for hours , smiling and Uncle Tomming everytime a doctor or a nurse passed by.</span></p>
