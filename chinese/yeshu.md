<p><span class="chinese">该病不仅由野鼠传播给人群，而且通过野鼠感染实验动物，形成实验室感染，二次传播从事动物实验的人群。</span><span class="english">Moreover, labo ratiory animals could get the disease from the sick wild rats, which would result in laboratory infection with the technicians involved.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">如果野鼠一些受化学物质控制的行为看上去很熟悉，也许是因为人类也产生催产素和抗利尿激素。</span><span class="english">Hostess If some of the chemically-controlled behavior of the prairie vole seems familiar, perhaps it's because human beings also produce oxytocin and vasopressin.</span></p>

NestedPCR was used to test Borrelia burgdorferi in spleen, kidney and bladder of rats.</span></p>
