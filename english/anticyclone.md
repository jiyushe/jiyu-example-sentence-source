<p><span class="chinese">用定常热源做的试验表明台风上层的反气旋环流是台风发展的结果。初始风场的垂直切变不利于台风的发展。</span><span class="english">Assuming constant heating source, it is found that in upper layer the anticyclone is the result of the development of typhoon.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">夏季流场比较复杂，总环流大致呈反气旋型，且垂向结构略有变化。</span><span class="english">In contrast, the aestival circulation shows the anticyclone pattern and its vertical structure has few changes in that season.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">位涡收支方程各项对高压发展、减弱有着不同的作用。</span><span class="english">The various terms in the potential vorticity equations have made very different contributions to the evolution of the anticyclone.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">天津市的气侯，夏天受季风影响以湿热为主，冬天受西伯利亚高气压影响则以寒冷干燥为主。</span><span class="english">Tianjin's climate is characterized by hot, humid summers, due to the monsoon, and dry, cold winters, due to the Siberian anticyclone.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">在南半球，反气旋绕高压中心反时针方向吹，与北半球情况相反。</span><span class="english">In the Southern Hemisphere an anticyclone circulates counterclockwise around the high-pressure center, as contrasted to the Northern Hemisphere.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">三家模式对地面冷高压的预报均偏弱，且EC和T639模式误差的大值区出现在高压后部。</span><span class="english">The models all predict the weak surface anticyclone, and for T639 and EC models the errors are mainly located in the northwest of the anticyclone.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">受到在中国大陆的一个反气旋影响，21W将于未来72小时沿该反气旋的东南部向西南或西南偏西移动。</span><span class="english">Subject to the anticyclone anchored in central China, 21W will move along its southeastern periphery in a SW to WSW direction in the next 72 hours.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">结果该区域产生了垂直上升运动及负的涡度强迫源，对应着异常强烈的反气旋环流。</span><span class="english">This generates ascent as well as negative vorticity source, which corresponds to a strongly anomaly anticyclone center appearing to the north of the heating region.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">中国第2次北极科学考察期间正是北极平流层中上层暖性反气旋性环流向冷性气旋性环流转变和极涡建立时期。</span><span class="english">The transition of the circulation from a warm anticyclone to a cold cyclone occurred in the middle and upper stratosphere during 2003 Chinese Arctic Research Expedition.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">华北地区夏季降水异常与印度西南季风、南海东南季风、副热带高压、南亚高压及冷空气异常都密切相关。</span><span class="english">Summer rainfall anomalies in North China relates to the Indian summer monsoon, the South sea monsoon, Sub-tropical anticyclone, South Asian anticyclone and cold air anomaly.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">弓状回波前进方向的左侧和右侧气旋式旋转和反气旋式旋转，决定着未来强对流天气发展加强和减弱消散的方向。</span><span class="english">The left and right cyclone and anticyclone rotation of the bow echo on its forward way decides the direction of developing or decreasing of the future strong convection weather.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">根据影响的天气系统，将温州地区的降水性质分为冷空气、倒槽、西南低涡、静止锋、台风、副高边缘对流等典型降水类型。</span><span class="english">According to the weather system the rain of Wenzhou are classified into cold air, inverse trough, southwest low vortex, Mei-Yu, typhoon, convection on edge of subtropical anticyclone.</span></p>
