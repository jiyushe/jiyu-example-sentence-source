<p><span class="chinese">主茎总叶数的变化是量测小麦春化反应性的一个可靠指标。</span><span class="english">Finalleaf number on main stem could be a reliable measure for wheat vernalization response.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">并对春化相关基因克隆方面的进展进行了分析和综述。</span><span class="english">Also introduced are the research achievements about cloning of vernalization -related genes.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">在冬型小麦的春化过程中有短日光周期效应。</span><span class="english">The effect of short-day photoperiod is evident in the vernalization process on the ecotype of winter wheat varieties.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">甘蓝型油菜依据开花是否需要低温春化，分为春性油菜品种和冬性油菜品种。</span><span class="english">According to the requirement of vernalization or not, rapeseed can be divided into two types, the winter annuals and the spring annuals.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">春化作用看来好像是由分生组织自身感受的，因为当植株处于低温条件下而对分生组织进行保暖时，并不能诱导成花。</span><span class="english">Vernalization appears to be sensed by the meristem itself, as chilling the plant while the meristem is warmed does not induce flowering.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">在春化过程中，POD酶活性在适宜春化时间内随春化时间延长而增加，且抗寒性增加。</span><span class="english">During the vernalization, POD isoenzyme activity increased with lengthening of vernalization time and the cold hardiness of wheat improved.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">对春化基因及其等位变异的研究对小麦冬、春性的遗传改良具有重要指导意义。</span><span class="english">Researches on the vernalization gene and its allelic variation can efficiently facilitate the improvement of growth habit in breeding program.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">夏菊品种夏黄完成春化过程所需的温度范围较宽，16℃以上的温度即能满足其春化需求。</span><span class="english">The requirement for vernalization of a summer-flowering chrysanthemum cultivar'Summer Yellow'could be met in a very wide range of temperatures even over 16℃.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">三联期是大麦通过春化阶段和幼穗分化开始的形态指标，而小麦是二棱期。</span><span class="english">The period of tripe mound of barley is the morphological symbol to complete the vernalization phase and start ear initiation, but the wheat is in double ridge.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">当归移栽后当年抽苔是制约当归生产的主要障碍，而提早抽苔是已通过春化阶段之故。</span><span class="english">Earlier bolting at the same year of transplanting is main limited factor of Angelica sinensis production, which was resulted from finished vernalization period.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">低温春化特性与抗寒性是品种的两种特性，低温春化有利于小麦抗寒性的形成。</span><span class="english">Therefore we could say vernalization and freezing tolerance were two characteristics of wheat, and vernalization was beneficial to forming of freezing tolerance of variety.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">在对以往有关不同开花途径研究简要总结的基础上综述了FLC基因在春化过程中的作用。</span><span class="english">The lately researches of the function of FLC in the process of vernalization are reviewed in this article on the basis of summarizing various pathways those promote flowering.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">大白菜通过春化到抽薹开花其间表现出一叶色转变过程，叶色转变后就会现蕾进而抽薹开花，在弱冬性品种上的表现尤为突出。</span><span class="english">Brassica. rapa. shows transition of leaf color during the period from vernalization to bolt, then it will appear bud and bloom. This phenomenon appears more frequent in easy bolting species.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">随着气温回升，茶树也渐渐开始萌动，应进行修剪，并及时追施“催芽肥”，促其多分枝，多发叶，提高茶叶产量。</span><span class="english">With the rise of temperature, tea also gradually began to sprout, should be pruned, and timely topdressing "vernalization fat", promoting the multi branch, multi leaf, increase the yield of tea.</span></p>
