<p><span class="chinese">沥青混凝土路?。</span><span class="english">Asphaltic concrete road?</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">以不同渣油和FCC油浆为原料，在实验室合成了沥青树脂。</span><span class="english">Asphaltic resins were synthesized from residual oil and FCC slurry in laboratory.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">志留系沥青砂岩的成岩作用特征等资料证明，沥青砂岩的形成是烃类多期次注入的结果。</span><span class="english">Diagenesis data indicate that the Silurian asphaltic sandstones are the products of multiple fillings of hydrocarbon.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">原油粘度特大，密度相对较高，族组成以非烃和沥青质组分为主，饱和烃含量低。</span><span class="english">Its group composition is dominated by nonhydrocarbon and asphaltic components, with a low content of saturated hydrocarbon.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">鉴于目前高速公路沥青路面通车里程快速增加的同时，沥青混合料离析这一难题也日益突出。</span><span class="english">With the rapid increase of the mileage of asphalt road, segregation of the asphaltic concrete is therefore becoming increasingly prominent.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">当铁路出售旧的关系，处理是因为它们往往与杂酚油，沥青产品的防止腐烂对待的问题。</span><span class="english">When railroads sell their old ties, disposal is an issue because they are often treated with creosote, an asphaltic product that prevents rot.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">根据渣油性质和吹空气时间长短的不同，可生产出性质不同的沥青材料。</span><span class="english">Depending on the characteristics of the residual oil and the length of the blowing time, asphaltic materials of varying characteristics are produced.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">由于沥青混凝土材料强度的温度依赖性，弯沉以至路面结构承载能力都随温度而变化。</span><span class="english">Since asphaltic concrete materials are temperature dependent in nature, measured deflections and hence the structural capacity of pavement vary with temperature.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">在油窗内由相对高温所生成的原油。成熟油含有较低的分子重量和较少的沥青成份。有高的API。</span><span class="english">Crude oil that has been generated by relatively high temperatures in the oil window. Mature oil contains lower molecular weights and less asphaltic compounds. It has high API.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">原料中的芳烃含量及结构特点是影响沥青树脂性能的关键因素。</span><span class="english">The results showed that the content of aromatics in the feedstock and the structural characteristics were the key factors which influencing the performance of the asphaltic resins.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">在大多数情况下，正确的半液体OGL使用的最终结果看起来很像老式的溶于石油的沥青应用。不过外观会因厂商而异。</span><span class="english">In most cases, the end result of a proper semi fluid OGL application will look much like an old asphaltic solvent cutback application, but appearances will vary between manufacturers.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">用这种方法可以通过侧线采出分离出真空瓦斯油或锭子油和润滑基础油，同时在底部分离沥青组分或燃料油。</span><span class="english">In this way, the vacuum gas oil or spindle oil and the lubricating bases are separated by means of lateral extractions while an asphaltic component or fuel oil is separated at the base.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">现场施工采取“旁站”监理方式，并建立沥青混凝土试验室对施工质量进行跟踪检测，保证了施工质量。</span><span class="english">The construction was supervised at job site, and an asphaltic concrete laboratory was set up for monitoring the construction quality, in order to guarantee the high construction quality.</span></p>
