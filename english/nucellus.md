# nucellus

<p><span class="chinese">珠被生长较快，并逐渐包围珠心。</span><span class="english">The integument grew fast and overgrew the nucellus.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">另外的粉管核会在花粉管穿过珠心时发生分裂。</span><span class="english">The tube nucleus disintegrates as the pollen tube penetrates the nucellus.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">雌性孢原为珠心亚表皮下多细胞。</span><span class="english">The female archesporium differentiates from many cells under the subhypodermis of nucellus.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">雌性孢原处于珠心表皮之下，为单细胞。</span><span class="english">The female archesporium differentiates from the single cell under the epidermis of nucellus.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">珠心表皮下的雌性孢原直接发育为大孢子母细胞。</span><span class="english">The archesporial cell below nucellus epiderm functions directly as the megaspore mother cell.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">营养物质可以贮藏于由珠心产生的一种特殊组织，叫外胚乳。</span><span class="english">Food materials may be stored in a special tissue derived from the nucellus , called the perisperm.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">胚乳细胞质团追接胚乳吸器和外侧的珠心组织，它可能是胚乳吸器一个活跃的功能单位。</span><span class="english">This mass, which connected the haustorium with nucellus was likely to be as an active functional unit of haustorium.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">发育初期的胚乳组织在反足极有一突起，并插入珠心组织。</span><span class="english">At early developing stage, the endosperm tissue has a projection that inserts nucellus tissue in the antipodal cells.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">同时在珠心细胞中观察到旺盛的分裂活动和细胞团的形成，这可能是二倍体植株的来源。</span><span class="english">Embryological observation of ovary culture shows that haploid plants are from megaspore tetrad, while diploid plants are probably from nucellus cell.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">孢原细胞位于珠心表皮之下，直接起大孢子母细胞的功能。</span><span class="english">The ovule is bitegminous and tenuinucellate. The archesporial cell locates under the nucellus epidermis, which develops into functional megasporocyte.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">珠心细胞只有两层，细胞核大，胞质丰富，内含贮藏物质，至心形胚期逐渐解体。</span><span class="english">There were only two layers of nucellus which had abundant cytoplasm and reserved substance, and were consumed at the stage of late heart-shaped embryo.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">在这个过程中珠心的二倍体细胞发育为胚胎，二倍体种子的遗传组成与亲本完全相同。</span><span class="english">It includes the process whereby a diploid cell of the nucellus develops into an embryo giving a diploid seed with a genetic constitution identical to the parent.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">对珠心苗高接植株多年观察及品质鉴定，认为珠心胚植株在品质上表现较大差异。</span><span class="english">After years of observation and assessment on the top-grafting plants of nucellus seedlings, considerable quality variations were found among nucellus embryo plants.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">红松和油松杂交不孕的主要原因是，油松的花粉不能在红松的珠心上发芽。</span><span class="english">The main cause of the incompatibility between P. koraiensis and P. tabulaeformis is the pollen of P. tabulaeformis showing poor or no germination in the nucellus of P. koraiensis.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">进一步提高外源激素浓度，珠心细胞又可以分化出新的胚珠原基，进一步长大以后发育成许多新的胚珠。</span><span class="english">Upon further increase of the exogenous hormone concentration, new ovule primordia could be formed from the proliferated nucellus cells, which further developed into many new ovules.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">传粉后约4周，珠心顶端破裂，分泌物进入珠孔道，并与珠被分泌物共同作用于花粉，使花粉向珠心移动。</span><span class="english">About 4 weeks after pollination, the tip cells of nucellus broke and secreted liquid into ovular canal, which promoted pollen movement to the nucellus and played important role for pollen germination.</span></p>
