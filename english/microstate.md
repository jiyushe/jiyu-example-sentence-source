# microstate

<p><span class="chinese">这是一个系统的微观状态。</span><span class="english">So this is a system microstate.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">其中pi是某个微观状态的概率。</span><span class="english">Where the p's are the microstate probabilities.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">因此处于这种状态的概率是。</span><span class="english">So the probability of being in that microstate is one.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">好，现在来计算微观状态的能量。</span><span class="english">Ei Alright, so now let's take our microstate energy here.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">这样每个微观状态的能量都相同。</span><span class="english">Every single microstate is going to have the same energy.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">告诉我们分子处于哪个能级。，And，that，little，n，tells，you，which，energy，state，that，molecule，is。,对所有能量求和就得到微观状态能量。</span><span class="english">n And the sum of all these energies is your microstate energy.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">它是对,所有分子能量的求和。</span><span class="english">And our microstate energy is the sum of all the molecular energies Ei.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">如果我以系统的一个微观状态为例，也就是所有粒子的集合，所有那些状态也有相同的能量。</span><span class="english">If I take a microstate of the system, you know, the whole collection of the particles, all of those states also have the same energy.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">通过使用透射电子显微、相差显微和粒度分布分析，对荧光增白剂OB和OB-1的结晶性能、微观形态及在PP中的分散状态进行了研究。</span><span class="english">TEM, phase microscope and particle size analysis were used to research the conformation of FWA OB and OB-1 and their microstate in PP.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">在那里，她被邀请穿越法国边境到达附近的超小国家摩纳哥在宫殿与王子合照。</span><span class="english">While there, she was invited to travel across the French border to the neighboring microstate of Monaco for a photo-shoot with the prince at his palace.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">为实现这个目标，小型微代码存储器有ROM构成，微状态机转移为大型微代码存储器和复杂的硬件单元以及序列发生器。</span><span class="english">Small microcode stores were built from ROM and microstate machines were moved to large microcode stores and to complex hardware units and sequencers, to achieve those goals.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">其它状态的概率都是,这就是我们,要导出的关系，它是个很有意思的结论，我们来推导它。</span><span class="english">And the probability of being in every other microstate is zero. Alright, so there's a relationship that we're going to have here, which is going to be interesting. Let's derive it.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">这种推引原子谱项的方法适用于各种等效和非等效电子组态的原子体系。</span><span class="english">Based on microstate generating function, a term generating function and atomic terms were obtained. The method is suitable for both equivalent and nonequivalent electronic configurations.</span></p>
