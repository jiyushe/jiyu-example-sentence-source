<p><span class="chinese">即使是在前震相当普遍的地区，也无法将前震与独立地震区分开来。</span><span class="english">Even in areas where foreshocks are fairly common, there is no way of distinguishing a foreshock from an independent earthquake.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">利用小波域方法求解了玉树的一个前震以及四个余震的震源机制解。</span><span class="english">The mechanisms of one foreshock and four aftershocks of Yushu earthquake were determined by the wavelet domain inversion method.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">地震发生之前，地球没有发生任何征兆，例如前震，电信号，水体信号或其他任何信号。</span><span class="english">The earth gave no indication with a foreshock or an electric signal or a water signal or anything else that an earthquake was about to begun.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">同时还研究了35个前震、余震及震群序列的分维特征，发现其中29个存在分维结构。</span><span class="english">Simultaneously, we also studied the subdimensional feature of 35 foreshock , aftershock and swarm series and found that 29 of the 35 had subdimensional texture.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">根据前震活动对强震作短临预测既已获得突破，有待在世界范围内再见成功震例。</span><span class="english">We are expecting the appearance in the world of the second example of the successful impending prediction of a strong earthquake based on sequential foreshock activity.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">研究认为，时间结构变异诊断法不仅可以用作前震序列和余震序列以及正常震群活动的判断，同时也适用于区域地震活动状态的描述。</span><span class="english">The TFCM can be used to judge foreshock series, aftershock series and normal seismic activities, and it can also be applied to describe the characteristics of regional seismic activities.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">并且，大地震的一个4级以上前震与一般小震群中的同量级地震发生前的应变释放速率是不同的。</span><span class="english">Furthermore, a foreshock with magnitude over 4 of a large earthquake differs in the rate of strain release from that of an earthquake of the same magnitude of an ordinary earthquake swarm.</span></p>
