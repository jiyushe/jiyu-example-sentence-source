<p><span class="chinese">杰贝兹·威尔逊先生大笑起来。</span><span class="english">Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">当神祝福雅比斯的时候，他的性格特征发生了改变。</span><span class="english">Jabez had his character changed when God blessed him.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">为何雅比斯的一个普通的祷告会如此风行？</span><span class="english">Why such a common prayer of Jabez would be so popular?</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">为什么雅比斯被认为比其他弟兄更尊贵呢？</span><span class="english">Why was Jabez considered more honorable than his brothers?</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">与雅比斯的祷告相比，这些祷告更接近神的本意。</span><span class="english">Such are more in accordance with God's ideal compared to this prayer of Jabez.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">神对于雅比斯的祷告不但注意了，而且还回应了他的祷告。</span><span class="english">God not only gave Jabez His full attention, He was pleased to answer his prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">他们很穷。从今天读的这段经文里面看到，很明显，雅比斯的家庭正在经历困苦挣扎。</span><span class="english">It's evident from this passage that there was a struggle going on in the family of Jabez.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">更好的方法是，像雅比斯那样祷告，求神能使我们远离试探。</span><span class="english">Better yet, join Jabez and pray that God would keep the temptation away from you in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">那是一双很漂亮的黑靴，可是杰贝兹·史东始终觉得它们不顺眼，尤其是鞋尖部分。</span><span class="english">They were handsome black boots, but Jabez Stone never liked the look of them, particularly the toes.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">这是一个无比顽强的生命见证，这是一段充满恩典之路的日子，这是一个憧憬伟大期待的心灵。</span><span class="english">A testimony to life's indomitable will, blessed with grace each day, little Jabez is a great soul of expectation.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">雅比斯比他众弟兄更尊贵，他母亲给他起名叫雅比斯，意思说，我生他甚是痛苦。</span><span class="english">Jabez was more honorable than his brothers. His mother had named him Jabez, saying, 'I gave birth to him in pain.'</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">杰贝兹对这个任务觉得奇怪，但还是接受了。随后的两个月杰贝兹认真抄写，几乎已经抄完了所有A开头的词条。</span><span class="english">Jabez thinks strangely to this duty, but accepted. afterward two month Jabez transcribes earnestly, nearly already copied the entry which all A begins.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">鉴于当前美国那些即使很富有的基督徒的贪心和不满足的程度，雅比斯的祷告极其流行也就不足为怪了。</span><span class="english">It is not surprising today that the Jabez prayer has become extremely popular given the degree of greediness and discontentment of even rich American Christians.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">雅比斯求告以色列的神说，甚愿你赐福与我，扩张我的境界，常与我同在，保佑我不遭患难，不受艰苦。</span><span class="english">Jabez cried out to the God of Israel, 'Oh, that you would bless me and enlarge my territory! Let your hand be with me, and keep me from harm so that I will be free from pain.</span></p>
