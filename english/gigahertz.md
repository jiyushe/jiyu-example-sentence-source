# gigahertz

<p><span class="chinese">你还需要一个速度至少1GHz的处理器。</span><span class="english">You'll also need a processor with a speed of at least one gigahertz.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">一个3.2千兆赫兹的处理器每秒能发生32亿左右的脉冲。</span><span class="english">A 3.2 gigahertz processor sends out around 3.2 billion pulses each second.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">通过这种方案，可以达到超过千兆赫的超快运行速度。</span><span class="english">Ultrafast operational speed larger than gigahertz can be expected from this all-optical scheme.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">几年前，人们购买电脑只能看着兆赫，或者有多少千兆赫，等等。</span><span class="english">A few years ago people buying computers only looked at megahertz, or how many gigahertz , and so on.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">根据非对称矩形同轴线原理研制了宽带吉赫横电磁波室。</span><span class="english">A gigahertz TEM cell is developed according to the principle of asymmetric rectangular coaxial line.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">在传统的原子钟里，原子受到吉赫波段的微波照射。</span><span class="english">In a traditional atomic clock, atoms are illuminated by microwaves, in the gigahertz frequency range.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">如果现在的设计趋势继续下去的话，他说，十几年后微芯片的频率将达到30G的频率。</span><span class="english">If current design trends continue, he said, microchips will be running at 30 gigahertz by the end of the decade.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">普朗克探测到的光波-低频范围从30-857千赫-是我们肉眼无法观察到的。</span><span class="english">Planck detects light that we can't see with our eyes -- light with low frequencies ranging from 30 to 857 gigahertz.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">随著操作频率超过十亿赫兹，晶片电感所造成的效应将不能再像往常一样的被忽略。</span><span class="english">As the operating frequency reaches over gigahertz , the effect of inductance can no longer be ignored as it used to be.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">直至最近，这种状况都是靠提高时钟频率达到的，在我有生之年，我已看到处理器主频从几千赫兹上升至几吉赫兹。</span><span class="english">Up until recently, this was accomplished by accelerating the clock speed, which has leaped from kilohertz to gigahertz in my lifetime.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">大多数先进FPGA能够处理速度为数百兆赫兹的并行总线和具有工作在千兆赫兹范围的串行接口。</span><span class="english">Most advanced FPGAs can handle parallel bus speeds of hundreds of megahertz and have serial interfaces that operate in the gigahertz range.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">最后，感知无线电技术具有的智慧型运作礼节，将为许多使用者把数十亿计的未使用频谱变成宽频连线。</span><span class="english">Ultimately, smart operator etiquette based on cognitive radio technology will turn gigahertz of underused spectrum into wideband connectivity for many users.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">再让我们来看看这台机器，它是什么配置呢？这台，是的，我的Mac，AIR，我不关心John的,他的可能还更好，我的CPU是1。8G的。</span><span class="english">So let's think about it. This sucker, Mac AIR what's it got in there? That Air Mac, it's, see, it's got, its go-- my Air Mac, I don't know about John's, his is probably better, mine has 1.8 gigahertz speed.</span></p>
