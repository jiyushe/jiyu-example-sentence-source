<p><span class="chinese">电影院今天放一部新电影。</span><span class="english">Heute läuft ein neuer Film im Kino.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">吉纳已经发现了世上最大的珍珠。</span><span class="english">Kino had found the Pearl of the World.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">吉纳发现了世界上最大的珍珠。</span><span class="english">Kino has found the Pearl of the World.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">那天基诺出去采珍珠了。</span><span class="english">That day, Kino went diving for pearls.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">但是奇诺已经从人群中往外挤了。</span><span class="english">But Kino was pushing his way through the crowd.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">奇诺本能地知道自己的戏剧效果。</span><span class="english">Now Kino instinctively knew his own dramatic effects.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">也许基诺会割掉自己的脑袋，把自己毁了。</span><span class="english">Maybe Kino has cut off his own head and destroyed himself.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">奇诺听到早潮轻轻拍着沙滩的声音。</span><span class="english">Kino heard the little splash of morning waves on the beach.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">奇诺一点也想不起，他在醒来时也曾看到它们闭着过。</span><span class="english">Kino could never remember seeing them closed when he awakened.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">在这一阶段kino应该是有趣且打情骂俏的。</span><span class="english">Kino should be fun and flirty during this stage – anythingdominant and push-pull is great.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">弄清楚谁是吉纳后，医生变得严肃认真而又明智起来。</span><span class="english">And when it was made plain who Kino was, the doctor grew stern and judicious at the same time.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">奇诺掀起睡席，把珍珠挖出，搁在面前呆呆地看着。</span><span class="english">Kino raised the sleeping mat and dug up his pearl and put it in front of him and stared at it.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">电影短片也是德国视野影院及新生代规划程序里的组成部分。</span><span class="english">Short films are also a regular constituent of the Perspektive Deutsches Kino and Generation programmes.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">这个作物将提供种子给北方50哩的沿岸城市德奇诺湾计画中的主要冒险计画。</span><span class="english">That crop will provide seed for a major venture planned 50 miles north in the coastal city of Bahia de Kino.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">奇诺飞快地伸出手去，从他手里把珍珠抢走。他把它包在鹿皮里，又塞进了他的衬衣。</span><span class="english">Kino reached quickly and snatched the pearl from his hand. He wrapped it in the deerskin and thrust it inside his shirt.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">在基诺和胡安娜看来，这是他们一生中最了不起的早晨，只有宝宝出生的那一天，才可以与之媲美。</span><span class="english">For Kino and Juana this was the morning of mornings of their lives, comparable only to the day when the baby had been born.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">吉纳发现珍珠前，他---一位可以看病的医生拒绝给孩子治病，因为吉纳付不起治疗费。</span><span class="english">Before Kino found the pearl, the only doctor available had refused to treat the baby because Kino could not afford to pay for the treatment.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">奇诺的脑子里这会儿就有一支歌，有明朗又柔和，假如他说得出的话，他会管它叫作“家庭之歌”。</span><span class="english">In Kino 's head there was a song now, clear and soft, and if he had been able to speak of it, he would have called it the Song of the Family.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">这时奇诺起身了，用毯子裹起脑袋、鼻子和肩膀。他把脚伸进凉鞋，走到屋外，去看破晓的天色。</span><span class="english">Now Kino got up and wrapped his blanket about his head and nose and shoulders. He slipped his feet into his sandals and went outside to watch the dawn.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">基诺说，经过审核许多伊拉克难民的文件，他坚信，瑞典的一些官员已被驱逐谁在伊拉克面临的真正威胁。</span><span class="english">Kino says that after examining the files of many Iraqi refugees, he is convinced that Swedish officials have deported some who face real threats in Iraq.</span></p>
