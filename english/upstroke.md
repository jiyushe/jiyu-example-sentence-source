<p><span class="chinese">最大光杆负荷发生在上行冲程开始时的冲程底部附近。</span><span class="english">The peak polished rod load occurs near the bottom of the stroke with the start of the upstroke.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">现代鸟类在飞行时也需要依赖这块腕骨，它们通过这块骨骼牵引翅膀以获得抬升力。</span><span class="english">Modern birds use a similar bone in flight, drawing their wings toward their bodies during an upstroke.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">如果力量转移压力减少，泵浦意志向上的一击为了增加泵浦的产品。</span><span class="english">If the power shift pressure decreases, the pump will upstroke in order to increase the output of the pump.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">用飞行翼的上下行程，身体向上移动，但随后的冲程可以对抗这种力量。</span><span class="english">With the down stroke of a wing during flight, the body moves up, but the subsequent upstroke can counter that force.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">丙戊酸钠和异搏定对动作电位幅度、超射值、静息电位、O期最大除极速度均无明显影响。</span><span class="english">Neither sodium valproate nor Verapamil showed any effect on action potential amplitude, overshoot, resting potential and phase O upstroke velocity.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">在大多数抽油机上都使用平衡块来平衡在上冲程时的油和抽油杆柱的重量以及在下冲程时的抽油杆柱重量。</span><span class="english">A counterbalance is used on most pumpers to balance the weight of oil and sucker-rod string on the upstroke and the sucker-rod string on the down stroke.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">通过近水平和上运大型带式输送机制动工况和起动工况的张力分析，明确了制动装置位置对输送带张紧力的影响，进而提出大型输送机制动与张紧装置的优化布置方法。</span><span class="english">According to the belt tension analysis of the large near-horizontal and upstroke conveyor during braking and starting, this paper gives the effects of brake location on the take-up tension.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">介绍应用静液传动二次调节技术的液压抽油机的工作原理及节能原理，该系统能很好地解决上下冲程中的功率匹配问题。</span><span class="english">The working principle and characteristics of hydrostatic transmission system with secondary regulation were introduced. The new system can match power perfectly during upstroke and down stroke.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">例如，鸟儿在腾飞上升的顶点合起它们的翅膀——这是公园里鸽子腾飞时扑哧的声音——在降落时旋转它们的翅膀以获得升力。</span><span class="english">For example, birds clap their wings together at the peak of the upstroke during takeoff — that's the clatter of a pigeon taking off in the park — and rotate their wings on the way down to get lift.</span></p>
