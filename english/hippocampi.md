<p><span class="chinese">在昏暗光条件下的海马比起黑暗环境下的海马减少了重要的树突棘。</span><span class="english">The hippocampi from the dim-light group had significantly fewer dendritic spines than those from the dark night group.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">结论体内外雌激素含量的变化可影响大鼠皮质和海马区域BACE表达。</span><span class="english">Conclusions The variation of estrogen contents could influence the expression of BACE in the cortex and hippocampi CA1 of rats.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">分别在移植后第2、4、8、12周4个时间点取脑冷冻切片，在倒置荧光显微镜下观察移植细胞的存活和迁移。</span><span class="english">Cryostat sections were cut coronally through the hippocampi of the brains at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 after transplantation respectively.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">缺血脑损伤大鼠皮层海马脑区的兴奋性氨基酸明显高于正常对照组。</span><span class="english">The levels of exciting amino acids in hippocampi and cortex of ischemic brain injury rats were significant higher than those of controls.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">结果表明人类大脑中确实存在着磁性物质，并且在海马部位表现最明显。</span><span class="english">The results show that magnetic material exists in the brain of human being indeed, and the region of hippocampi exhibit magnetism the most obvious.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">例如，与控制组比，自杀者的海马的尸检研究显示更少的肾上腺皮质激素受体。</span><span class="english">For instance, postmortem study of hippocampi from the brains of people whocommitted suicide show fewer glucocorticoid receptors comparedwith controls.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">而对照组的动物，具有正常的神经发生，最后可以绕过它们的海马，直接从长期储存中找回恐惧记忆。</span><span class="english">Control animals, with normal neurogenesis, eventually were able to bypass their hippocampi and retrieve the fear memory directly from long-term storage.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">研究员制造了2类基因突变的老鼠，一种是在他们的海马状突起大脑侧面脑室壁上的隆起物有丰富的NR1分子，另外一种是没有NR1的。</span><span class="english">The researchers created two strains of transgenic rats, one that had an abundance of NR1 subunits in their hippocampi and one in which it was suppressed.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">然后发现长时间惊厥的小鼠所产生的神经群落较短期爆发惊厥的小鼠多。</span><span class="english">More neurospheres were derived from the hippocampi of mice that had exhibited prolonged seizures than from those in which seizures occurred in short bursts.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">就拿最近的一项研究来说，它显示了“年长的成年人中，比起那些体型不良的人来说体格健美的人拥有更发达的海马体和更好的空间记忆能力。”</span><span class="english">A recent study, for example, showed that “elderly adults who are more physically fit tend to have bigger hippocampi and better spatial memory than those who are less fit.”</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">2004年麦吉尔大学的大鼠试验发现母鼠的某些特定行为使幼鼠大脑海马区的某些基因沉默，小鼠处理应激激素的能力因而下降。</span><span class="english">A 2004 McGill University study of lab rats found that certain maternal behaviors can silence a gene in the hippocampi of their pups, leaving them less able to handle stress hormones.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">那些失败学员的海马体自始至终没有发生变化，这表明成功的的士司机确实具有先天优势——他们的大脑比其他人更具延展性。</span><span class="english">The hippocampi of unsuccessful trainees stayed the same throughout, which could suggest that successful cabbies really do have an innate advantage—their brains are more malleable than others'.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">取大鼠右侧大脑海马CA1区组织标本，经过处理后透射电子显微镜观测细胞形态学改变并摄片。</span><span class="english">To observe and take a photograph of rats nerve cell morphological changes through electron microscope after sampling and dealing with cerebral tissue specimen of right side hippocampi CA1 section.</span></p>
