<p><span class="chinese">于是埃克曼坐下来仔细观察影片，可一无所获。</span><span class="english">So Ekman sat and looked at the film. Nothing.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">当Ekman第一次遇到他的现任妻子时，他已经结过婚了。</span><span class="english">When Ekman first met his current wife he had been married before.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">但埃克曼指出，如果稍加训练，几乎人人都能或多或少掌握些技巧。</span><span class="english">But given a bit of training, Ekman says, almost anyone can develop the skill.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">据Ekamn记录，人们通常会用微笑来掩饰真实的情绪。</span><span class="english">One of the most common thing people doin hiding emotions, Ekman notes, is to smile.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">事实上，艾克曼有更多实质性工作,同他的科学工作一起。</span><span class="english">Ekman actually has a sort of more practical career along with his scientific career.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">保罗艾克曼博士博士和大卫松本创建梅特，在线微表达的训练工具。</span><span class="english">Dr. Paul Ekman and Dr. David Matsumoto created METT, an online micro expression training tool.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">消亡过程则是由于局地涌升增强以及东南向的埃克曼流导致。</span><span class="english">The decay of spring warm pool is because of local strengthening upwelling and southeast Ekman currents.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">Ekman说，这些就是“象征性泄露”，表示对象试图隐瞒或改变真相。</span><span class="english">These are "emblematic slips," Ekman says, and indicatethe subject is trying to suppress or alter information.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">当埃克曼进行相反的实验的时候，把先前的新几内亚人的面孔呈现给西方人，表情还是被辨认出来了。</span><span class="english">When Ekman conducted the experiment in reverse, showing Fore faces to Westerners, the emotions were again unmistakable.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">Ekman研究欺滦为已经超过四十年了并且是该主题好几本书的作者。</span><span class="english">Ekman has been studying deceptive behavior for more than four decades and is the author of several books on the subject.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">据埃克曼所知，一部商业电视剧仅仅基于一位科学家的研究，这还是首次。</span><span class="english">It is the first time, as far as Ekman is aware, that a commercial TV drama has been based on the research of just one scientist.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">在一个经典的研究项目中，保罗埃克曼拍下了一组人的照片，分别表示愤怒、厌恶、恐惧、幸福、悲伤。</span><span class="english">In classic research Paul Ekman took photographs of people exhibiting the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">我是艾克曼，我想你是否介意我今天晚上去拜访你一下，就是说如果你不忙的话。</span><span class="english">This is Ekman speaking. I was wondering if you'd mind if I dropped in for a few minutes this evening. That is, if you're not going to be busy.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">受这些发现的启发，Ekman便着手去建立一个可以将任何一个人的复杂面部表情进行编码的系统。</span><span class="english">Encouraged by these findings, Ekman then set out to organize a system by which he could codify the complex facial expressions of any given person.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">对于没有经过训练的眼睛，虽然几乎没有可能能够看得出来，但是，是可以很快地学习如何去读它的---一个小时之内，根据Ekman的说法。</span><span class="english">To the untrained eye, they are virtually impossible to spot, but we can learn to read them, quite quickly apparently -- in about an hour, according to Ekman.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">Ekman告诉我，”有时候是因为情绪，人们知道他们的感觉却蓄意试图掩盖---这情绪可能是不好意思或着是其他更不好的原因。</span><span class="english">Ekman tells me, "Sometimes it's an emotion they know they're feeling and are deliberately trying to hide -- it could be embarrassment or something more sinister."</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">梅特和METT2正在停产，但都埃克曼和松本已经制定了各自的网站表达他们自己的微型训练软件。</span><span class="english">METT and METT2 are being discontinued, but both Ekman and Matsumoto have developed their own micro expression training software available on their respective sites.</span></p>
