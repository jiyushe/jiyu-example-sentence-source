<p><span class="chinese">鲍兹·尼格罗一直没有重新修建他的房屋。</span><span class="english">Boaz Negro did not rebuild his house.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">于是，波阿斯娶了路得为妻，与她同房。</span><span class="english">So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">而波阿斯与路得，便是大卫王的曾祖父母。</span><span class="english">Boaz and Ruth were the great-grandparents of king David.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">当那位至亲作出决定之后，便轮到波阿斯发言。</span><span class="english">As soon as the unknown relative's decision was known Boaz spoke up.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">波阿斯问监管收割的仆人说、那是谁家的女子。</span><span class="english">Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, "Whose young woman is that?"</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">当拿俄米从路得口中得知波阿斯如何善待她们，心中感到异常的感动和兴奋。</span><span class="english">Naomi was tremendously excited when she heard what Boaz had said and done.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">接著我们听到门外有人在叫喊，原来是波阿斯已经获得同意，可以娶路德为妻。</span><span class="english">Outside we heard shouting, and we figured that Boaz had been granted permission.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">尽管鲁思对请求波阿斯照顾自己和内奥米感到害羞，但她还是同意了。</span><span class="english">Although Ruth felt shy about asking Boaz to look after herself and Naomi, she agreed.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">波阿斯和摩押女子路得在大约主前的1120年结婚，那个时期也正是睚珥作士师的时候。</span><span class="english">Boaz married Ruth the Moabitess about 1120BC which was in the time of the Jair Judge.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">波阿斯正从伯利恒来，对收割的人说，愿耶和华与你们同在。</span><span class="english">Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, "The LORD be with you!"</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">波阿斯问监管收割的仆人说、那是谁家的女子。</span><span class="english">Then Boaz said to his servant who was in authority over the cutters , Whose girl is this?</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">波阿斯在收割禾田时，上帝也祝福他，连他的工人也同蒙福。</span><span class="english">So was Boaz blessed when he reaped his harvest, and his workmen met him with benedictions.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">到了吃饭的时候，波阿斯对路得说，你到这里来吃饼，将饼蘸在醋里。</span><span class="english">At mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar."</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">拿俄米知道波阿斯是他们的亲戚，却不知道还有另一个人与她们有更亲的关系。</span><span class="english">Naomi knew Boaz was a relative but did not know there was another man even closer in relationship.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">就像她为拿俄米拾取麦穗，她现在想最为波阿斯的妻子服侍他。</span><span class="english">Just as she had worked for Naomi gleaning the wheat she now wanted to minister to Boaz as his wife.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">如今，波阿斯与路得终于相遇，故事便开始发展至它的高潮。</span><span class="english">BOAZ-THE MAN OF GOD Now Boaz and Ruth have met and the story begins to develop further to its climax.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">拿俄米的丈夫以利米勒的亲族中，有一个人名叫波阿斯，是一个大财主。</span><span class="english">Now Naomi had a relative of her husband's, a worthy man of the clan of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">波阿斯很高兴鲁思来向他寻求帮助，并让她带着麦子回家做为给内奥米的礼物。</span><span class="english">Boaz was pleased that Ruth had come to him for help, and sent her home with a gift of barley for Naomi.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">于是路得与波阿斯的使女常在一处拾取麦穗，直到收完了大麦和小麦。</span><span class="english">So Ruth stayed close to the servant girls of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">然而，波阿斯却清楚知道，路得虽是摩押女子，但她已真心信靠以色列的神。</span><span class="english">Boaz clearly recognised that although Ruth had come from Moab, she had become a true believer in Israel's God.</span></p>
