<p><span class="chinese">那么詹姆斯·麦卡沃伊会接演比尔博·巴金斯这个角色吗？</span><span class="english">Will he take on the role of Bilbo Baggins?</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">显示的内容为Thror的地图和一个比尔博巴金斯表的副本。</span><span class="english">Shown are Thror's map and a replica of Bilbo Baggins' table.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">因此寻找适合的毕尔博扮演者对电影的成败至关重要。</span><span class="english">Finding the perfect Bilbo is essential to the success of the film.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">不过，无辜的比尔博当天早上所见的，只是一名拿着拐杖的老人。</span><span class="english">All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">马丁弗里曼，比尔伯巴金斯的扮演者，对导演不吝赞扬之情。</span><span class="english">Martin Freeman, who plays Bilbo Baggins, bubbled with praise for his director.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">比尔博命中注定会得到魔戒。从这个意义上讲你得到它也是必然的。</span><span class="english">Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which case you also were meant to have it.</span></p>
