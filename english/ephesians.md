<p><span class="chinese">之间的关系，书信的以弗所和彼得更接近。</span><span class="english">The relationship between the Epistle to the Ephesians and I Peter is much closer.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">有是一个了不起的相似性，这之间的书信和向以弗所书。</span><span class="english">There is a remarkable resemblance between this epistle and that to the Ephesians.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">所以我们可以判定以弗所书的写信人,似乎是另一位作者。</span><span class="english">So we can tell that the writer of the Ephesians seems to have been a different author.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">以弗所书的写信对象,似乎不只一个教会。</span><span class="english">The letter to the Ephesians looks like it was not actually written to only one church.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">保罗在以弗所书第四章劝谕读者除去旧我，穿上新我。</span><span class="english">In Ephesians 4, Paul urges his readers to take off the old self and put on the new self.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">歌罗西书和以弗所书已经在家庭中,建立起明确的家长等级关系。</span><span class="english">Already in Colossians and Ephesians they set up the household in a clear hierarchical patriarchal situation.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">所以有些学者认为,也许以弗所书原本是一份通函。</span><span class="english">So some scholars have suggested that maybe the letter to the Ephesians was originally intended as a circular letter.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">以弗所书第1章和罗马书第8章清楚告诉我们，你和我都是蒙神收纳，才能成为神的家庭的一分子。</span><span class="english">Ephesians 1 and Romans 8 tell us clearly that through the honor of adoption you and I have become part of God's family.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">只因他们认出他是犹太人、就大家同声喊着说、大哉以弗所人的亚底米阿．如此约有两小时。</span><span class="english">But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">我们之所以这样认为的原因之一,就是以弗所书的一些旧稿里，“致以弗所教会“这样的说法并不存在。</span><span class="english">And one of the ways we think this--one of the reasons we think this is because in some of the old manuscripts of Ephesians, "To the Ephesians" is not there.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">以弗所书则由保罗的另一信徒执笔，他伪造保罗的书信,模板是保罗的书信，或者他所持有的一些保罗的书信。</span><span class="english">Ephesians was written by a different disciple of Paul, and he was using as his model for a Pauline letter the actual letters of Paul, or at least some of them that he possessed and knew of.</span></p>
