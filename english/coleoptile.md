<p><span class="chinese">胚芽鞘内含少量的叶绿素并且通常是感光的。</span><span class="english">The coleoptile contains very little chlorophyll and is usually light-sensitive.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">温特证明，这种活性物质从活的燕麦胚芽鞘扩散到凝胶中去。</span><span class="english">Went showed that this active agent diffused into gelatin from living oat coleoptile tips.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">石蒜碱处理的小麦胚芽鞘切段细胞延长明显被抑制。</span><span class="english">Lycione inhibits the cell elongation of wheat coleoptile and the activity of peroxidase also.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">实验中还发现，辐照后温6的胚芽鞘呈现紫红色的变异现象。</span><span class="english">Moreover, it was found that the coleoptile of Wen6 became purple with the ion beam implantation.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">向光性刺激后，胚芽鞘向光侧和背光侧生长素的含量没有出现明显的差异。</span><span class="english">There was little change of IAA on both sides of the coleoptile which was treated with phototropic stimulation.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">这可能引起组织松弛而导致胚芽鞘生长的机械阻力降低。</span><span class="english">This may cause tissue weakening, resulting in reduction of the mechanical resistance to the growth potential of the coleoptile.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">这表明这种转录光调控可能参与了光敏色素介导的对水稻胚芽鞘生长的抑制。</span><span class="english">It is suggested that this transcriptional photoregulation participates in the phytochrome-mediated inhibition of rice coleoptile growth.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">测定分析了种子基本性状与芽鞘长度的关系以及外源激素对芽鞘伸长的影响。</span><span class="english">The relationship between coleoptile length and some seed characteristics, and the effects of plant hormones on the growth of coleoptiles were also investigated.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">研究结果表明，在中国北方发现的部分杂草稻具有较强的中胚轴伸长特性和芽鞘节间伸长特性。</span><span class="english">Results showed that the elongation of mesocotyl and internode of coleoptile played important roles in the seedling emergence of the weedy rice from northern China.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">水稻幼根的呼吸存在有细胞色素途径，但以抗氰交替途径为主，幼根的生长可能主要受被氧肟酸抑制的抗氰交替途径所控制。</span><span class="english">Basing on these facts, it has been assumed that the respiration of coleoptile and young root of rice seedling might be mediated by different electron transport pathways.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">明确赤霉素敏感性不同的矮秆基因对小麦株高和胚芽鞘长度的效应，促进小麦不同矮秆基因的合理利用。</span><span class="english">Understanding the effects of wheat dwarfing genes on coleoptile length and plant height is crucial for the proper utilization of dwarfing genes in yield improvement of wheat.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">从幼苗形态、第一叶长以及胚芽鞘长的变化进行比较，结果表明，矮秆波兰小麦所含矮秆基因对赤霉酸反应不敏感。</span><span class="english">The comparison of the seedling morphology and length of coleoptile and the first leaf after GA_3-treatment indicates that the dwarfing trait of dwarfing Polish wheat is GA_3-recessive.</span></p>
