<p><span class="chinese">根据错误数据，他和克里克建立了一个DNA结构模型还很自豪地邀请伦敦小组到剑桥观摩。</span><span class="english">Based on it, he and Crick built a model of DNA’s structure and proudly invited the London group up to Cambridge to inspect it.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">他的实验室主任把DNA项目从他身边抢走而他的朋友克里克在富兰克林的数据帮助下解决了问题。</span><span class="english">His lab chief had taken the DNA project away from him and his friend Crick had solved it with the help of Dr. Franklin’s data.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">“所以振作起来即便我们给你严重警告那也是朋友间的玩笑，”1951年克里克写到。</span><span class="english">“So cheer up and take it from us that even if we kicked you in the pants it was between friends,” Crick wrote in December 1951.</span></p>
