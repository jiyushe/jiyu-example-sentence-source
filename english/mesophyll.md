<p><span class="chinese">实验还显示出，马铃薯叶肉原生质体自体融合频率明显高于异体融合频率。</span><span class="english">Meanwhile, the frequency if higher in homo-fusion than in hetero-fusion for mesophyll protoplasts.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">马铃薯叶肉细胞原生质体培养后，再生细胞形成细胞团和愈伤组织。</span><span class="english">The mesophyll cell protoplasts of potato could divide from cell colonies and callus after cultured.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">影响马铃薯叶肉原生质体褐化的主要因素是6-BA和基因型，还有NAA等其它因素。</span><span class="english">The major factors influencing the browning of potato mesophyll protoplasts were 6-BA, genotypes and NAA.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">此外，在严重水分胁迫下，抗旱性较弱的品种有明显的质壁分离现象。</span><span class="english">In addition, plasmolysis occurred in the mesophyll cells of drought sensitive cultivar under severe water stress.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">由于叶肉细胞可进行光呼吸，故突变型之光合作用能力不受到影响。</span><span class="english">Since mesophyll cells photorespire, photosynthetic capacity of the mutant would not be affected by this mutation.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">该组合具有冬性强、结球紧实、叶球淡绿色、叶肉厚、品质佳等特性。</span><span class="english">Both of the new hybrids have the characters of strong winterness, compact bulb, greenish leaf, thick mesophyll and good quality.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">其它光质下单位叶面积细胞数目依次为黄、红、白和绿光下的叶片。</span><span class="english">Generally speaking, the leaves grown in yellow light had more number of mesophyll cells than those grown in red, white, and green light.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">结果表明，培养初期，先以外层少数叶肉细胞开始RNA和蛋白质的合成，接着DNA也开始合成。</span><span class="english">The result showed, a few mesophyll cells of outer layer began RNA and protein synthesis at culture initial stage, then, DNA began synthesis.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">并利用原位RT-PCR技术做进一步检测，证明苹果叶片中有苹果皱果类病毒存在，主要分布在叶肉细胞的细胞核中。</span><span class="english">At the same time, in situ RT-PCR of AFCVd for further detection proved that AFCVd existed in apple leaf and mainly located in nucleus of mesophyll cell.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">幼叶中层既可由亚边缘原始细胞或远轴层叶肉的第一个细胞单独产生，也可由它们二者共同产生。</span><span class="english">The middle layer of laminae is brought about either by submarginal initials of by the first cell of the abaxial layer of mesophyll alone or by both of them.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">叶缘直接产生的不定芽主要由叶片表皮下叶肉细胞单独分裂形成分生组织细胞团，并进一步分化从而发育而成。</span><span class="english">Mesophyll cell of leaf epidermis can single split into group meristematic cell, then more differentiation make it developed into adventitious bud on leaf margin.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">叶部表皮的表皮毛和气孔器明显增多、叶肉细胞排列较对照结构疏松且细胞间隙大。</span><span class="english">Additionally, the numbers of stomata and trichomes on the leaf lower-surface increased, and mesophyll cells were looser arranged and its intercellular space was larger.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">细胞学观察表明，培养后叶肉细胞明显增大，细胞分裂形成分生组织，由之形成芽原基。</span><span class="english">Cytological observations showed that mesophyll cells were greatly enlarged, undergoing repeated cell divisions, then forming meristematic mass, from which buds were initiated.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">其表达方式与互补链基因启动子相似，即在叶肉及叶脉维管组织均有较高的活性。</span><span class="english">Expression pattern of trans-activated virion sense promoter was similar to that of complementary sense promoter with the high activity in both mesophyll and vascular of leaf vein.</span></p>
