<p><span class="chinese">目的观察尸僵再形成中肌节长度的变化。</span><span class="english">Objective To observe changes of the length of sarcomere of rat when restiffening.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">肉样经HMP处理后，肌节基本上保持原有结构，只是Z盘处稍有弱化发生。</span><span class="english">The sarcomere struture of HMP also remained basic structure except the weakening at Z disk.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">肌联蛋白是一种巨型蛋白，对肌小节的组成和弹性有重要作用。</span><span class="english">Background— Titin is a giant protein crucial for the assembly and elasticity of the sarcomere.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">另外，一些与肌小节无关的基因突变也参与了该病的发生。</span><span class="english">In addition, a lot of mutations having nothing to do with sarcomere proteins also contribut to this disease.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">结果死后未破坏的尸僵肌节的长度明显小于尸僵再形成时的长度。</span><span class="english">Results The length of sarcomere of rigor mortis without destory is obviously shorter than that of restiffening.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">结果死后未破坏的尸僵肌节的长度明显小于尸僵再形成时的长度。</span><span class="english">Results The length of sarcomere of rigor mortis without destroy is obviously shorter than that of restiffening.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">并没有在其余的患者发现别的肌节蛋白基因突变以造成其他家庭成员的心尖肥厚型心肌病。</span><span class="english">No other sarcomere gene mutations identified in the remaining probands caused apical HCM in other family members.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">由于PSE肉部分肌球蛋白变性，其肌原纤维的舒展肌节长度总是小于正常肉。</span><span class="english">The sarcomere of PSE pork was shorter than that of normal pork because of the partial denaturation of PSE myosin.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">是一个分布式的基于网格信息检索的信息检索软件。</span><span class="english">Sarcomere is distributed information retrieval software based on the Grid Information Retrieval GIR proposed standard.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">心脏组织超微结构得到明显改善，心肌细胞肌丝整齐，肌节规则，Z线，M线，H带尚清晰。</span><span class="english">It showed that myoneme of cardiac muscle cell was integral, sarcomere was regulation, Z line, M line and H band was clear.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">分析了骨骼肌细胞骨架在维持骨骼肌肌小节的正常结构和功能中的重要性。</span><span class="english">And analyzed the importance of cytoskeleton of skeletal muscle in maintaining the normal structure and functions of sarcomere of skeletal muscle.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">目前为止，发现的和扩张型心肌病相关的基因突变主要是心肌蛋白基因突变和细胞骨架蛋白基因突变，此外还有线粒体DNA的突变和能量代谢相关的基因突变。</span><span class="english">The mutations of sarcomere filament protein and cytoskeletal protein were largely found in familial DCM, and the mutations in mitochondrial DNA were also found in familial DCM.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">在人类，在编码与构成肌小节有关的蛋白质的基因中，现在发现至少有11种基因，超过200种不同的基因突变类型与肥厚型心肌病有关。</span><span class="english">It is the most common genetic cardiac disease, there are at least 11 genes that encode sarcomere proteins, more than 200 types of mutations relate to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">已知的可导致肥厚性心肌病和扩张性心肌病的肌节蛋白基因突变，可能和左室心肌致密化不全相关。</span><span class="english">We speculated that mutations in sarcomere protein genes known to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy may be associated with left ventricular noncompaction.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">本实验证实肌肉两端的肌节长度小于肌肉中部的肌节长度，而中部肌节长度的变化很小。</span><span class="english">In the present experiments, it was confirmed the sarcomere length near the ends of the muscle was shorter than in the middle and the sarcomere length variation in the middle was extremely small.</span></p>
