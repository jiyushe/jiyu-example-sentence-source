# tropopause

<p><span class="chinese">一达到对流层，温度就停止随高度上升。</span><span class="english">As soon as the tropopause is reached, temperature stops decreasing with height.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">从偏冷期到偏暖期，整个热带对流层顶显著变暖。</span><span class="english">The whole tropical tropopause has been warmed up from cold period to warm period.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">目前对中纬度地区对流层顶折叠和切断低压的研究是比较充分的。</span><span class="english">Tropopause folding and cut-off low in mid-latitude were well studied in the past.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">通常对流层温度直到对流层顶都是随高度增加而不断地减小的。</span><span class="english">As a rule, the temperature in the troposphere decreases steadily with increasing altitude until the tropopause is reached.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">强大的西风气流有时曾在离赤道大约9个纬度的巴西Recife上空的对流层顶附近观测到过。</span><span class="english">Strong westerlies, at times, have been observed near the tropopause over Recife, Brasil, approximately 9o from the equator.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">最大偏差主要发生在近地面大气层、对流层顶附近和地形复杂的陆地区域。</span><span class="english">The largest differences are near the ground and in tropopause region, particularly over the land with complicated topography.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">气压指数和气温指数都显示出准11年及准3-5年的主要周期，二者的变化趋势基本上是一致的。</span><span class="english">The dominant periodicities as detected in the index of either pressure or temperature at tropopause are the 11 year and 3-5 years.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">阐述了冬夏复合对流层顶的频率分布情况以及北京、汉口等站对流层顶的日际变动。</span><span class="english">The frenqu-ency distribution of compound tropopause in summer and winter and inter-diurnal variation of various categories of tropopause over Beijing.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">对流层顶折叠使高空臭氧向下输送，这种向下的输送可以到达对流层中部，对上对流层的臭氧影响最大。</span><span class="english">The downward transport of ozone due to tropopause folding can reach middle part of troposphere, which has the most influence on the ozone in the upper troposphere.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">利用北京地区1977—1990年的高空、地面资料，讨论了极地对流层顶与地面温度的关系。</span><span class="english">The relationship between arctic tropopause height and surface air temperature is discussed by using the aerological sounding and surface data during 1977-1990 in Beijing area.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">对流层高层或平流层低层高位涡的下传有利于位势不稳定能量的释放，使得暴雨增幅。</span><span class="english">The tropopause folding, which means that high PV spreads downward from the upper troposphere or stratosphere, helps the releasing of potential instability energy and the development of rainstorm.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">分析大气监测资料、TOMS臭氧总量资料和NCEP大气环流资料表明，大气臭氧总量随着对流层顶的低一高一低变化呈高一低一高的变化过程。</span><span class="english">Analysis of the observational data, the TOMS total ozone, and NCEP circulation, shows that the atmospheric ozone amount experienced a high-low-high variation with low-high-low tropopause altitude.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">从平均对流层顶高度的年变化看来，对流层顶高度与平流层低层温度呈负相关，与对流层温度呈正相关，且存在季节差异。</span><span class="english">From annual change of the tropopause height, it was negatively related to lower stratospheric temperature and positively associated with the troposphere temperature, and there was seasonal difference.</span></p>
