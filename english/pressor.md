<p><span class="chinese">电刺激下丘脑“防御反应区”诱发升压反应。</span><span class="english">Pressor response was induced by electrical stimulation of the hypothalamic defence area.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">结果表明，该树脂吸水性能好，并具有良好加压保水能力。</span><span class="english">The result indicates the hydroscopicity of this resin is good and has good pressor absorbent power.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">家兔H_1受体调节的升压作用亦可被阿托品所阻断。</span><span class="english">In addition, the pressor effect mediated by H_1- receptors in rabbits could beantagonised by atropine.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">但是如果破坏异侧DM，对此升压反应并无明显影响。</span><span class="english">In contrast, when the contralateral DM was lesioned, the Glu-induced PFTG pressor response was little affected.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">但若肾功能不全或肾脏缺氧时，可导致胺的蓄积，完全有可能显示升压作用。</span><span class="english">However, if renal insufficiency or renal hypoxia, can lead to accumulation of amine, pressor effect may be displayed fully.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">它会阻止的升压剂，血管紧张素Ⅱ，在血管平滑肌和肾上腺中对AT1受体结合。</span><span class="english">It blocks the binding of the pressor agent, angiotensin II, to the AT1 receptors in vascular smooth muscle and in the adrenal gland.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">在升压最高峰时，脑脊液内单胺类递质的代谢产物无明显变化。</span><span class="english">When the pressor effect was the highest, monoamine metabolites did not change significantly in CSF sampled from the terminal of midbrain aquaduct.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">作者采用山羊慢性肺淋巴瘘模型，观察缺氧、小剂量的内毒素单独及复合作用，对清醒山羊肺动脉压、肺微血管壁通透性及肺组织问液形成的影响。</span><span class="english">The effects of hypoxia and endotoxin, acting alone or in combination, on pulmonary pressor response and lung fluid exchange were studied in 9 conscious goats.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">这种升压作用既不被可卡因所增敏，又不被苄唑啉所拮抗，故与交感机制无关。</span><span class="english">This pressor effect of atropine appeared to be unrelated to the sympathetic mechanism, as it was neither potentiated by cocaine nor antagonized by tolazoline.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">作者采用山羊慢性肺淋巴瘘方法，观察缺氧、空气栓塞单独和复合作用，对清醒山羊肺动脉压、肺微血管壁通透性和肺内液体交换的影响。</span><span class="english">The effects of hypoxia and air microembolism on pulmonary pressor response and lung fluid exchange were studied in eight conscious goats with chronic lung lymph fistula.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">本文提出了一种将模拟退火算法和遗传算法相结合的混合遗传算法，并将其引入输气管压气站优化运行问题中。</span><span class="english">The paper presents a hybrid genetic algorithm which marries simulated annealing with genetic algorithms, and applies it to com- pressor station' s optimal operation of gas transmission line.</span></p>
