<p><span class="chinese">例如在氢原子里面,如果你取一个结合能,它的负数就是。</span><span class="english">So, for example, in a hydrogen atom, if you take the binding energy, the negative of that is going to be how much energy you have to put in to ionize the hydrogen atom.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">当你用光照射一个,你要研究的原子,来得到它的光电子能谱时，你要确保,注入的能量足够,令原子中的任何一个电子被发射出来。</span><span class="english">And what happens when you irradiate one of these atoms that you're studying with this light is in photoelectron spectroscopy, you want to make sure that you put in enough energy to actually ionize any single electron that you have in the atom.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">原因是,铝的有效核电量更少，所以没有被原子核束缚得更紧，而如果没有被束缚得更紧，你为了电离它所需要注入的能量也就更少，这就是,它的电离能会更低的原因。</span><span class="english">The reason it's aluminum is because aluminum has a lower z effective, so it's not being pulled in as tightly by the nucleus, and if it's not being pulled in as tightly, you're going to have to put in less energy in order to ionize it, so that's why it's actually going to have the smaller ionization energy.</span></p>

<p><span class="chinese">那么，E，i，即入射光子所具有的能量，如果足够大到使原子发射出一个电子，则电子就会被发射出来,并带有一定的动能，动能的大小正好等于,初始能量减去为了电离,或者说发射出这个电子,所消耗的能量。</span><span class="english">So e sub i, some energy that the photon comes in with, and if it has sufficient energy to eject an electron, it will do that, and our electron will be ejected with a certain kinetic energy, which is going to be whatever energy is left over from the initial energy we put in minus what was taken up in order to actually ionize or eject the electron.</span></p>
